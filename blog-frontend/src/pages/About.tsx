          <br />I became obsessed with the <strong>math behind ML and AI</strong>, ever since I saw <strong>Jarvis</strong> in Iron Man (Not
          sure if that is lame or cool honestly).
          <br />
          <br />
          This blog‚Äôs for anyone who‚Äôs <strong>curious</strong>, <strong>stuck</strong>, or just needs something <strong>real</strong>. No
          AI slop. No BS. Just <strong>authentic human content</strong> from someone in the loop with you.

                  No AI tools will be used to write this blog's content in any way. <strong>NONE</strong>. I made this blog to combat the
                  currently upcoming urge to rely on AI tools such as ChatGPT to get more creative and honestly to hell with that.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  So if you're reading this, you're reading <strong>me</strong>, not a prompt, not a prediction, but a person.

              body: (
                <>
                  I made this blog because I couldn‚Äôt find anything like it. And what exactly is this you may ask, real advice from someone
                  actually walking the same path, not just recycling hype. It‚Äôs about <strong>documenting my learning journey</strong> and
                  inviting others to <strong>learn and grow with me</strong>. I post what I‚Äôm reading, studying, and reflecting on.
                  <br />
                  <br />I <strong>hate gatekeeping</strong>, and I genuinely believe the future, especially here in <strong>Egypt</strong>,
                  belongs to those who keep their skills <strong>sharp</strong> and stay <strong>focused</strong>. I once heard, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
                  easier than ever to win because everyone else is distracted‚Äù, and with all the BS currently happening with AI, I believe
                  that with all my heart.
                  <br />
                  <br />I hope this blog becomes a <strong>light post</strong> for anyone stuck in a <strong>learning</strong> or{" "}
                  <strong>life loop</strong> and a <strong>beacon of hope</strong> for anyone who believes it is too late to make a
                  difference, because let me tell you from someone who used to believe that, <strong>it isn't</strong>!

                  Expect me to post <strong>3 blogs a week</strong>, a <strong>Weekly Deep Dive</strong> and 2 <strong>Mini Posts</strong>.
                  The deep dive is the <strong>heart of the blog</strong> and is usually something I <strong>learned</strong> or found
                  interesting during the week, maybe a <strong>textbook chapter</strong>, a <strong>research paper</strong> that finally
                  clicked, or a <strong>mini project</strong> I built with a full walkthrough.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The mini blogs might be <strong>personal updates</strong>, <strong>recommended resources</strong>, or{" "}
                  <strong>short thoughts</strong> on what I‚Äôm currently self-learning or studying in college, and how I think it can be
                  applied.
                  <br />
                  <br />I try to be <strong>as creative as possible</strong>, and I hope that shows through in everything I write.

                  The name <strong>‚ÄúFound in the Loop‚Äù</strong> came from a time where I was <strong>stuck in a loop</strong>, full of{" "}
                  <strong>self-doubt</strong>, just <strong>consuming</strong> and not <strong>producing</strong>.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After reading the enlightening book <em>"The Millionaire Fastlane"</em>, I realized the world is run by{" "}
                  <strong>producers</strong>. So I flipped the switch. I started writing, creating, and putting myself out there. It wasn‚Äôt
                  easy, I still doubt myself, but then I discovered while reading the <em>"The War of Art"</em> that the thing that people
                  describe as doubt and laziness actually has a name and it's called <strong>Resistance</strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The moment I <strong>realized I was in a loop</strong> was the moment I <strong>found myself</strong>, and I believe this
                  is a place where you can find yourself too.
