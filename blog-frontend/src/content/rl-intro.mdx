# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

> **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.
- **Reward**: Feedback from the environment.
- **Policy**: The strategy used by the agent to decide actions.

Reinforcement Learning has powered innovations in fields like **robotics**, **game AI** (e.g., AlphaGo, OpenAI Five), and **real-time recommendation systems**.

## Example: Simple RL Loop (Python)

```python
for episode in range(100):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state
```

## Why RL is Exciting

- Powers breakthroughs in robotics, games (AlphaGo, Dota 2), and recommendation systems.
- Enables agents to learn complex behaviors from scratch.
