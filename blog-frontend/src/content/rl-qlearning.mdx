# Q-Learning Explained

Q-Learning is a popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It learns the value of taking a given action in a given state, known as the Q-value.

## Q-Learning Update Rule

The Q-value is updated as follows:

```math
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
```

Where:

- $s$ is the current state
- $a$ is the action taken
- $r$ is the reward received
- $s'$ is the next state
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor

## Example: Q-Table Update (Python)

```python
Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])
```

Q-Learning is the foundation for many modern RL algorithms.
