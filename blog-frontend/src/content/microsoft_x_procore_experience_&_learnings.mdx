  Titles like Microsoft and Procore turn heads, but <strong>juggling both at once while still a student?</strong> That’s what shows real
  devotion and discipline.
  <br />
  In this post, I’ll walk you through my journey landing two dream SWE internships in Egypt, the wild ride of working for two multinational
  tech giants for 2 months, and the real strategies I used to stay sharp, ship work, and stay sane.

We've got a lot to unpack, let's begin!

# <h2 id="why-i-did-it">1 · Why I was **crazy** enough to attempt this and why you should be too!</h2>

<br />

<p>
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
    Most people told me to pick one. “Focus,” they said. “Microsoft alone will keep you busy.” and I believed them. But one person stuck
    with me through my stubborness and motivated me to do better, my lovely mom.
    <br />
    She showed me that I didn’t need to settle not when I had the chance to experience **two** worlds, learn from **two** cultures,expand my network twice as quickly, and
    accelerate my growth faster than any single internship could.
    <br />
    So before I begin, I just wanted to say, **thanks mama**.
  </p>

{" "}

<hr style={{ marginTop: "2rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }} />

  <p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
    This wasn't about résumé stacking. It was about rewriting my limits.
    <br />
    And if you’re reading this thinking, **“Could I do the same?”** - the answer is yes. You might be scared. I was too. But growth doesn’t
    come from comfort. It comes from **perseverance** and **stacking the short-term wins** to reach that **long-term goal**.
  </p>
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "2rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  So let's get right into it and spill all the details about my EDC interview experience.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "2rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }} />

# <h2 id="the-interview-journey">2 · Cracking the <strong>Microsoft EDC interview</strong> </h2>

<br />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The journey started like most do: a <strong>HackerRank test</strong> sitting in my inbox, staring me down.
  <p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The first round was a timed coding assessment - <strong>two DSA questions</strong> and a handful of <strong>multiple choice</strong>{" "}
  problems covering everything from basic logic to object-oriented thinking.
  </p>

    style={{

        left: "50%",
        transform: "translateX(-50%)",
        marginTop: "1rem",
        marginBottom: "1rem",
        borderRadius: "0.5rem",
        maxWidth: "100%",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    }}
    />

</p>

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  A few weeks later, I got the email: **I passed**.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  What followed was a <strong>two-interview beatdown</strong>, both back-to-back on the same day - and honestly, it felt like a mini
  marathon.
</p>

    <img
    src="/assets/double-internship/microsoft-interviews.png"
    loading="lazy"
    alt="Interviews Invitation"
    style={{
        position: "relative",
        left: "50%",
        transform: "translateX(-50%)",
        marginTop: "1rem",
        marginBottom: "1rem",
        borderRadius: "0.5rem",
        maxWidth: "100%",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    }}
    />

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The <strong>first interview</strong> was a mix of system design and DSA. I was asked to implement a{" "}
  <strong>singleton logging system</strong> — think thread-safe, scalable, clean design. We talked about{" "}
  <strong>object-oriented principles</strong>, <strong>SOLID</strong>, and what makes a good design great. Then came a DSA problem (which,
  full disclosure, I can’t even remember - adrenaline does that).
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The <strong>second interview</strong> leaned heavier into data structures and algorithms. I was given the classic{" "}
  <strong>“Number of Islands”</strong> problem - a LeetCode staple - and solved it using <strong>Depth-First Search</strong>. We dove into{" "}
  <strong>time complexity</strong> discussions, array traversal optimizations, and general programming intuition.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Looking back, here’s what helped the most:
  <br />- Sharpening my fundamentals across <strong>DSA domains</strong>: trees, graphs, arrays, recursion.
  <br />- Brushing up on <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and <strong>OOP patterns</strong> like Singleton, Factory, etc.
  <br />- Doing some light <strong>systems design prep</strong> - enough to express ideas clearly and draw clean boundaries.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Don’t overthink it - you don’t need to be a genius, just <strong>well-prepared</strong>, <strong>calm under pressure</strong>, and ready
  to communicate your thought process. You’re not just being judged on correctness - you’re being judged on clarity and composure.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  And the best part? Once I finished both interviews, I walked out proud - not because I was perfect, but because I showed up fully.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  One and a half months later, I recieved the email that I was accepted.
</p>

    <img

    alt="EDC Acceptance Email"
    style={{

        maxWidth: "100%",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    }}
    />

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  That email **hit different**.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  After weeks of prep, uncertainty, and waiting - I was in. A student from Cairo joining one of the most respected engineering teams in
  Egypt.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  Not just any team, but <strong>Microsoft Egypt’s Development Center</strong>.
</p>

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  I remember reading that offer over and over, like I was trying to convince myself it was real. But it was. The real deal. And I was ready.
</p>
<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0rem" }}>
  The interviews were behind me - now it was time to show up, contribute, and absorb everything I could.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  Let me walk you through exactly what I worked on during my time at <strong>Microsoft Egypt</strong>, what tools I used, what I built, and
  what it felt like working shoulder to shoulder with engineers I once looked up to from afar.

# <h2 id="what-i-did-at-microsoft">3 · My work at <strong>Microsoft Egypt</strong>: Projects, tools, and team dynamics. </h2>

        maxWidth: "100%",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    }}
    />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  During my internship, I was placed in the <strong>MSN OneService team</strong> - a team responsible for a critical middleware layer that
  powers <strong>Microsoft News</strong> across the globe.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />I quickly realized just how deeply this service sits in the stack - touching infrastructure,
  data pipelines, and AI workflows all at once.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Due to NDA and sensitivity, I unfortunately can’t dive into the exact details of most of the work I contributed to. But what I can say is
  this:
  <br />I spent my internship neck-deep in <strong>Azure</strong>, working hands-on with real-world systems used at scale.
</p>

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />I deployed an <strong>o3-mini model</strong> on{" "}
  <strong>Azure AI Foundry</strong> which we used to evaluate the reasoning of another AI system.
  <br />I wrote automation logic in both <strong>PowerShell</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, deployed <strong>two Azure Functions</strong>,
  and extended an existing <strong>Logic Apps</strong> workflow to help streamline part of our team’s AI-driven evaluation loop.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Along the way, I picked up <strong>Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</strong> and learned to query massive telemetry logs using{" "}
  <strong>Kusto Query Language (KQL)</strong>. It was my first time working with a query language that felt designed for engineers —
  powerful, expressive, and lightning fast.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  I was also included in all team <strong>standups</strong>, <strong>scrums</strong>, and <strong>syncs</strong>. I was never treated as
  “just the intern” - I was treated like a real engineer. I even had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with senior engineers from{" "}
  <strong>Redmond</strong>, which honestly made the entire experience feel global.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  More than the tools or the tech, the biggest lesson I learned was this:
  <br />
  <strong>To thrive in this industry, you need to be proactive, humble, and always ready to learn.</strong>
  <br />
  Everyone I met, from interns to **principal engineers**, was kind, supportive, and driven by excellence. That mindset was contagious.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  **But the story doesn’t end there.** While I was working at Microsoft, I was also simultaneously interning at another incredible company —
  Procore Technologies.
  <hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
  Let me show you how I balanced both without losing my mind (or sleep).
</p>

# <h2 id="what-i-did-at-procore">4 · My role at <strong>Procore</strong>: Integration tests, CD Pipeline Integration, SWE x QA Work. </h2>

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  At the same time I was working at Microsoft, I was also growing through an entirely different challenge at <strong>Procore</strong>.
  <br />
  My main responsibility? Making sure <strong>integration tests</strong> for one of Procore’s most user-heavy applications were no longer
  confined to local machines, but fully running on every <strong>CD pipeline run</strong>.
</p>

    <img

        transform: "translateX(-50%)",
        marginTop: "1rem",
        marginBottom: "1rem",
        borderRadius: "0.5rem",
        maxWidth: "100%",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
    }}
    />

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  I can’t go into the specifics of the product, but I can share the stack and skills I picked up along the way.
  <br />I worked hands-on with <strong>Jenkins pipelines</strong>, <strong>Docker multi-stage builds</strong>, and even dove into
  <strong> PHP</strong> codebases - something I never thought I’d be doing, but which turned out to be an invaluable learning experience.
</p>

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The ticket itself was a beast - estimated at <strong>20+ story points</strong>. Every day was a push to understand more of the system,
  break down tasks into smaller deliverables, and steadily move towards a solution that the entire team could trust in production.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Beyond pure SWE work, I also wore my <strong>QA hat</strong>. I was responsible for <strong>manual testing</strong> tickets, identifying
  edge cases, and even writing <strong>test cases for an entire epic</strong>. It wasn’t just about finding bugs, it was about thinking like
  a user, predicting where things might break, and communicating clearly with developers to get things fixed fast.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Procore pushed me to step outside my comfort zone, sharpen my testing mindset, and embrace a culture where quality isn’t an afterthought -
  it’s baked into the process.

# <h2 id="balancing-both">5 · Balancing <strong>two tech giants</strong>: Time management, mindset, and avoiding burnout. </h2>

<br />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Balancing both internships was <strong>no walk in the park</strong>. There were days when it felt like I was juggling two worlds at once,
  constantly switching contexts and trying not to drop the ball. The saving grace was that each company’s meeting demands happened at
  different times, but besara7a (TBH) that didn’t make it easy.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Some days I was stuck in <strong>6 hours of meetings straight</strong>. I’d speak up in standup, then quietly switch gears and chip away
  at tasks from the other internship while still “present” in the call. It was survival mode, plain and simple.
  <br />
  On average, I dedicated <strong>6–8 hours a day</strong> to each internship. To keep myself accountable, I even{" "}
  <strong>tracked my time</strong> carefully, making sure neither side was neglected.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  The one thing that saved me was treating <strong>Friday and Saturday as sacred rest days</strong>. No coding. No Slack. No thinking about
  tasks. Just full mental reset. I’d immerse myself in books like <em>The Laws of Human Nature</em> by Robert Greene and
  <em> Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman, and I even tried to stay off LinkedIn (seriously, watching people claim they “trained
  ChatGPT to fly to Mars” is just unnecessary stress).
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Still, the grind caught up with me. I burned out for about a week - the fatigue, the brain fog, the lack of motivation. But thankfully,
  that week had <strong>two off-days built in</strong>, so I managed to bounce back faster than I expected. That experience taught me that
  <strong>rest isn’t optional, it’s a competitive advantage</strong>.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  My biggest advice to anyone attempting something like this? Treat <strong>sleep and recovery</strong> as if they were sacred. You can
  grind through long hours for a while, but without proper rest, your body and mind will eventually hand you the bill.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Looking back, balancing Microsoft and Procore at the same time wasn’t just about time management, it was about **mindset**.
  <br />
  It was about being intentional with every hour, and being brave enough to step away when I needed to recharge.
</p>

# <h2 id="gratitude-and-beyond"> 6 · Gratitude &amp; Horizons Ahead </h2>

<br />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  None of this would have been possible without the people behind the scenes who believed in me. First and foremost, I want to thank the
  <strong> HR teams at both Microsoft and Procore</strong> for approving what most would have called impossible - allowing me to pursue two internships
  at the same time.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  A huge thank you as well to my <strong>managers</strong> at both companies. Their encouragement and support gave me the confidence to keep
  pushing even when the workload was overwhelming. Having leaders who cared made all the difference.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  I also want to acknowledge my <strong>mentors</strong> throughout both internships. From debugging help to career advice, they were there
  every step of the way, and I truly couldn’t have done it without them. Their patience and wisdom will stick with me for years to come.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  My internship at <strong>Procore</strong> is still ongoing, and I’m excited to now have the space to focus on one role at a time. At the
  same time, I’m also preparing for my next <strong>ultralearning journey</strong>, building skills, exploring ideas, and one day creating
  something truly valuable.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />

<p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>
  Thank you so much for reading my story. If there’s one thing I hope you take away from this, it’s that you’re capable of far more than you
  think. With the right support, a willingness to learn, and a bit of stubbornness, even the “crazy” paths are possible.
</p>

<hr style={{ marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
